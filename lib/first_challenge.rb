#-- Iterate over the contacts hash and when you reach the key of :favorite_icecream_flavors, remove "strawberry" from the array of Freddy's favorite ice cream flavors. There are at least two ways you can accomplish this:
#-* 1) You can iterate through the hash and, when you reach the appropriate level, check to see if the key == ("is equal to") :favorite_icecream_flavors. If it does, check to see if that array contains "strawberry". If it does, then delete it from the array.
#-* OR 2) you can directly iterate over the hash that is the value of the "Freddy Mercury" key by calling an enumerator method in contacts["Freddy Mercury"].
#--- Hint: Use the .delete_if method to eliminate strawberry from the appropriate array.
#--- Hint: Remember that the first_challenge method needs to return the newly altered contacts hash.
